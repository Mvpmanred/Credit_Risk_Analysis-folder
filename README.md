# Credit_Risk_Analysis-folder

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is using my knowledge of the supervised machine learning models, I will evaluate these machine learning models by using resampling to determine which is better at predicting credit risk. First, I will use the oversampling RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and then I will use the undersampling ClusterCentroids algorithm. Using these algorithms, youâ€™ll resample the dataset, view the count of the target classes, train a logistic regression classifier, calculate the balanced accuracy score, generate a confusion matrix, and generate a classification report.

## Results

Below are the results from all machine learning models to predict for high risk loans.

## Summary
As we can see the results from all machine learning models above, Easy ensemble Classifier model has 93.21% accuracy score predicting the high risk loan status. It is the highest of all learning models. Moreover, it has 94% sensitivity. Sensitivity = True positive/(True positive + False Negative). It is also the hightest among all learning models. We recommend Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier model to predict high risk loand status.
